          <p>My name is Ron Dunphy. I studied for 6 years in college, primarily in the field of Science.  I worked independently in construction for 6 years, as well as a ten year tenure as a street performer. Computer programming is a recent transition for me that started 5 months ago.  I am looking forward to seeing where coding will take me.</p>
